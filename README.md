A Foundry VTT module that provides automation and effects for everything that I and other people might find fun :D

The final objective of OIF is to provide you with a nice and easy way of automating things inside your worlds, my approach to this is providing you with the best tools for setting these automations and cool effects yourself, the goal here is to give you power to customize without worrying too much about conflicts and coding.

Other design choice of the module is making it very _gamefied_, taking a little bit of control from your hands in exchange for a smoother experience.

**If you are searching for instructions on how to use the module, you can find it on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZotyDev/objects-interactions-fx/wiki)**

## Settings
Since all settings that aren't simple have a hint that explains how it works, there is no need to explain them here. 

Almost eveything in the module can be fine tuned to your desire, if there is something you want to be configured/added to the module leave a [issue](https://github.com/ZotyDev/objects-interactions-fx/issues/new) and I will try my best to implement it.
