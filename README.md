## Settings
Almost eveything in the module can be fine tuned to your desire, if there is something you want to be configured/added to the module leave a issue :)

## How to start
Currently, only single hit melee and ranged animations are supported. You also need to have JB2A Patreon animation collection to use the module. Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZotyDev/objects-interactions-fx) to see all the avaliable tags.
