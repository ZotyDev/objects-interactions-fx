# Automated Objects, Interactions and Effects

A Foundry VTT module that provides automation and effects for everything that I and other people might find fun :D

The final objective of OIF is to provide you with a nice and easy way of automating things inside your worlds, my approach to this is providing you with the best tools for setting these automations and cool effects yourself, the goal here is to give you power to customize without worrying too much about conflicts and coding.

Other design choice of the module is making it very _gamefied_, taking a little bit of control from your hands in exchange for a smoother experience.

**If you are searching for instructions on how to use the module, you can find it on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZotyDev/objects-interactions-fx/wiki)**.
